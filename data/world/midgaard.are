The Temple Of Mota~
You are in the southern end of the temple hall in the Temple of Mota.
The temple has been constructed from giant marble blocks, eternal in
appearance, and most of the walls are covered by ancient wall paintings
picturing gods, giants and peasants.
   Large steps lead down through the grand temple gate, descending the huge
mound upon which the temple is built and ends on the temple square below.
   Equally large steps lead UP through a small door into the ENTRANCE to MUD
SCHOOL.  (type 'up' to go to MUD SCHOOL.)  A small plaque is on this wall.
A large sign is hung by the paintings on the stone wall.

walls are covered in casual paisleys; the chairs are carved wood, rescued
from garage sales.  Most tables have chess or backgammon boards carved and
painted on their fingertip-smooth tops.  The refrain of some musical or
other from the 1930's blends with the dusty golden light and the wonderful
smells to put you completely at ease.  A huge picture window looks out
over the Midgaard River, and a doorway leads north onto the dock and the
South Bank river landing, while the main entrance to the south returns you
to Austral Square. On most days you will find Kate here, testing a batch
of stew or brewing a special pot of cinnamon coffee, eerily just in time
for your arrival Pull up a chair, perhaps play a game, and take time out
to talk.

Inside the North Gate of Midgaard~
Two small towers surround a strong wooden gate, connected by a small stone
bridge set with murder holes.  This gate is not as heavily guarded as the
others, as the plains outside are safe to travel.  You can leave Midgaard
to the north, or continue along wall road to the west and east.  A
teeming clan street is visible to the south, and beyond that the graceful
spires of the Temple of Mota, but there is no way to reach them from here.
